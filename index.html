          <p>Hi there!<br /> I'm a fullstack Software Engineer at C2FO. I find it's fun to build web apps. My insteret has recently shifted from backend to frontend and I'm becoming comfortable with coding javascript (espcially ES6). My favorite language is Python (Javascript is catching up and will replace it soon very likely) and I started my web dev journey by working on a Django project for 2 years. Then we switched to Ruby on Rails (Backend) and ReactJS (Frontend). Now at work I'm using ReactJS to build most frontend stuff and NodeJS for backend. GraphQL is a great layer that connects those two seamlessly.<br />
          I'm also a person that pushes myself to learn something regularly, because I really enjoy the process of learning in which I find myself more creative comparing to my daily work and may come up with awesome ideas sometimes.<br />
          At weekends, I watch and play soccer games. I've been following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A" target="_blank">Serie A</a> for more than 15 years and my favorite team is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Milan" target="_blank">Inter Milan</a>.

          <h2>How I became a web developer</h2>
          <p>I joined a database team at Cerner after graduating from USC EE department and worked on that team for one year and a half. Later, I found my strong insterest in knowing how websites work. So I started to pick up a course of web development at <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/web-development--cs253" target="_blank">Udacity</a> and spent two after-work hours every night catching up the course. That's the starting point of my career as a web developer. From then on, I tried multiple web dev frameworks like Django, Flask and Rails to build my toy apps and got a good understanding of how MVC works. I also figured out who I should follow on Twitter, Medium and Github so that I can get the latest and thoughtful updates for the news in web dev worlds. Then I got an opportunity to transfter to a web dev team that builds Django apps. After the transfer, I became a real web developer and learned tons of web dev stuff including responsive webpage, css pre/post processing, weird behaviors of IEs and javascript tech stacks, etc. Now I'm a fan of React and SPA (Single Page Application) and learning PWA (Progressive Web App).</p>
